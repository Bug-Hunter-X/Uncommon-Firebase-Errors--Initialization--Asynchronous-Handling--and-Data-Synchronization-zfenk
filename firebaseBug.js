The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided options are invalid or missing required parameters. For instance, initializing Firebase with an incorrect configuration object or missing an API key could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.  Another common issue involves handling asynchronous operations without proper error handling. If a Firebase function, like `onAuthStateChanged`, isn't handled with `.catch()` for errors, unhandled promise rejections might occur.  These aren't always immediately obvious, making debugging difficult.  Finally, data synchronization issues can result in stale or conflicting data, particularly when multiple clients interact with the same data simultaneously.  Incorrect use of transactions or listeners can make it difficult to maintain data consistency.
