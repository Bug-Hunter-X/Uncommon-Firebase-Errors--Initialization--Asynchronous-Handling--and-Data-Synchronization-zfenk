# Uncommon Firebase Errors
This repository demonstrates and provides solutions for some less common errors encountered when using the Firebase JavaScript SDK.  These go beyond simple typos or missing imports and involve deeper understanding of asynchronous operations, data consistency, and proper configuration.

**Errors Covered:**

* **Invalid Initialization Options:**  Incorrect configuration parameters can lead to silent failures or runtime errors.
* **Asynchronous Error Handling:**  Unhandled promises from Firebase functions can result in unexpected application behavior.
* **Data Synchronization Issues:**  Conflicting updates and stale data caused by incorrect use of transactions or listeners.

**Solutions:**

The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file provides solutions for each problem, demonstrating best practices for handling these situations.
